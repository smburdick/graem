Caeus V the Indefatigable is the sovereign of [Oblitus](../Oblitus/).

![main](main.png)

## Early life

Caeus is fifth in line of the House of Enizhal following his father Caeus IV.
At only thirty-five during his coronation, he was unprepared for
the responsibilities of a monarch. He frequently delegated his administrative
duties to the council, as he spent most of his days sailing, having
barely passed his examinations just a year prior to his investiture.

### Coronation

The year before his ascension to the throne, he took a journey to the Southern
Continent and met fierce trade winds, which ran his sailing yacht aground,
tearing it asunder. He survived on a remote island for five days, surviving
by his own wits and whichever conjuration spells he could recall from his
neglected studies. Upon his rescue, he was proclaimed "indefatigable" for
his persistence, however, Caeus was traumatized by the event, as he learned of his
father's death in battle upon returning home, and he did not speaking at
all during the enthronement ceremony. He did not develop a fear of sailing, but
used it as a distraction from work, which became a weak spot
for opportunistic advisors and foreign agents.

## Reign

Caeus was generally known as incompetent among his subjects and peers among
the other Mage States.

### Corruption

As a result of his carelessness and inexperience, Caeus was exploited by his own
council members and foreign Mage State dignitaries, in the guise of providing aid
to the Oblitian people, on a routine basis. One particular mage, Baron
Iduphior of Alshamsa, even directed rain showers needed by Oblitian famers
to his own province.  His machinations quickly led to a drought
and subsequent famine, decimating the local economy, until the
Amulet of Fluentum was recovered. By this point, Caeus' once supple figure had
slowly wasted away; he deferred all decision making to his aides and advisors.
