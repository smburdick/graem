**BF** stands for **Before the Fall**, and **AF** means **After the Fall**, in reference to
the number of years before or after the [Fall of the Old Empire](Fall_of_the_Old_Empire). This numbering
system is used commonly throughout Graem to date specific events; for example,
the present day is 100 AF, and the Genesis of Forsythia was at 10,000 BF.
