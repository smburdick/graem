## Geography

**Oblitus** is one of the southern Mage States. It is less than a day's journey
north of the [Southern Continent](../Southern_Continent/).

## Society and Politics

Oblitus is a fiefdom ruled by [King Caeus the Indefatigable](../Caeus_V/).
The Oblitians are frequently looked down upon by
denizens of other Mage States as "country bumpkins" due to their agrarian
lifestyle and lower degree of contributions to the Academy of Magi.

#### Famine

Oblitus experienced a severe famine, causing Caeus to commission the aid of a
motley crew of pirates and profiteers to recover the Amulet of Fluentum from the
southern continent, which had been lost for centuries after the siege of Sicco.
When the amulet was recovered, the mages summoned a monsoon, ending the famine
and restoring agriculture to Oblitus.
