The **Horror** is a dark, mysterious entity said to be the "root of all evil"
on Graem. During the [Primordial Era](../Primordial_Era), Horror
fell unto Graem and unleashed chaos unto it, shattering its mostly now-forgotten
civilization. Before Horror was finally contained, it weakened the boundaries
around Graem's reality, ushering the possibility of further planar incursions
and dooming the [Originals](../Originals) to never again be sovereigns of
Graem.
