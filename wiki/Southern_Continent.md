The **Southern Continent** is arid and forsaken by most of Graem. It is inhabited
mostly by bandits and opportunistic plunderers seeking treasures lost
to time.

## Hidden treasure

### Amulet of Fluentum

The Amulet of Fluentum was crafted by Rain Magi of [Sicco](Sicco), who hid
it inside a cloudy aura inside the Temple of Pluvia Chorus
during Sicco' siege in 200 [BF](BF_and_AF).
In 100 AF it was recovered by an adventuring party from
[Oblitus](Oblitus) hired by [Caeus](Caeus_V) to end an ongoing famine.
