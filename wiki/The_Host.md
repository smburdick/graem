The **Host** are a group of evil, powerful gods, who are former noble-caste humans of the
Old Empire. They became gods by discovering [Horror](../Horror), and immediately
thereafter decimated the Old Empire's population. They remain at war with
the remaining troops, which have come to include reinforcements from [Forsythia](../Forsythia/).
