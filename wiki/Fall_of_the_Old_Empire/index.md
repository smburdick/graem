The **Fall of the Old Empire** was a brief, yet cataclysmic battle fought
mostly in the [Western Mountains]() of Graem. It was thought to be a 50-year conflict,
lasting from 50 BF to 0 AF, leading to the establishment of the current
convention for marking the years, between [The Host]() and the mortal races of
Graem. The battle was mostly a stalemate,
