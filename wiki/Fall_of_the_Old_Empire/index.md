The **Fall of the Old Empire** was a cataclysmic battle fought
mostly in the Western Mountains of Graem between [The Host](../The_Host/) and the mortal races of
Graem, from 50 BF to 0 AF. The dates are only approximate due to divine temporal
distortions, though at 0 AF the battle was reduced to a stalemate which has lasted
from the previous century to the present day.
