**Sicco** is a razed and abandoned port town in the Southern Continent, about
one day's journey by sea south of [Oblitus](../Oblitus/).

## History

Sicco was established by Oblitus as a trading post and grew into a moderately
sized port town at the foot of Mount Praeceps.

### Rain Mages

Because of its proximity to the Mage States and dry climate, many Rain Mages
were deployed to Sicco. They learned how to summon monsoons and hurricanes,
and bestowed this power unto the [Amulet of Fluentem](../Southern_Continent/#amulet-of-fluentum).
One of Sicco's centers of study and prayer was the Temple of Pluvia Chorus,
perched on the top of Mount Praeceps.

### Invasion and demolition

The town was besieged by fire cultists who feared the magi's growing power
and influence in the region. During the invasion, the magi hid the Amulet
of Fluentum inside an aquatic aura above the altar of the Temple of
Pluvia Chorus, fearing its capture by the cultists. Nearly all of Sicco's
residents were purged in the attack, though some took refuge in Oblitus
and other isles of the Mage States. No structures were left standing, including the
Temple of Pluvia Chorus. Fire cultists have remained in the area since then, and have made
the surrouding underground into the home of a powerful fire ifrit.
