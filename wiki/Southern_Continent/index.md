The **Southern Continent** is arid and forsaken by most of Graem. It is inhabited
mostly by bandits and opportunistic plunderers seeking treasures lost
to time.

## Hidden treasure

### Amulet of Fluentum

The Amulet of Fluentum was long thought lost to time following the siege of
[Sicco](../Sicco/), until 100 [AF](../BF_and_AF) it was recovered by an adventuring party from
Oblitus hired by [Caeus](../Caeus_V/) to rescue [Oblitus](../Oblitus/) from an
ongoing famine.
