**Forsythia** is one of the provinces of Graem and home to wood-elves.

## History

### Genesis (10,000 BF)

A group of druids from Tenexaim awakened newborn forests in
the shivering primordial lands of Graem. Some of these druids entered the woods,
becoming the first Forsythians, and sent servants to Tenexaim, leading to a
tenuous but nonviolent neutrality between the two nations. The elves
prospered in their new domain, developing archery and other complex technology
and social structures, aided by their lengthy lifespans. A new wood-elf
identity emerged independently of the dragons. At this time, the fey
gods, including Unt, Curach, Krrsk and Gao appeared.

### Expulsion of the Orcs (5,000 BF)

At some point, Orcs came to Graem and appeared in the forests. Due to their
alien nature, the elves attempted to purge them, and remained feared throughout
Forsythia, despite an orc empire never emerging. Followers of Unt attempted to eliminate
the orcs, and followers of Curach, Krrsk and Gao sided with them in the battle, but the orcs left
the forests after years of bloodshed. Mixed feelings towards the orcs, defined by the factions in this war,
remain among the Forsythian elves in the present.
